    type: array
    description: >
      The resource IDs of the AnnotationSpecs that had been identified,
      ordered by the confidence score descendingly.

      enum: [0]  # As values of this enum all AnnotationSpec IDs the Model
      # was trained on will be populated.

      The display names of the AnnotationSpecs that had been identified,
      order matches the IDs.
    items:

  confidences:
    type: array
    description: >
      The Model's confidences in correctness of the predicted IDs, higher
      value means higher confidence. Order matches the Ids.
