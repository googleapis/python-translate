For a sample Python "mini-Google Translate" web app using the [Google Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate), go to https://github.com/googlecodelabs/cloud-nebulous-serverless-python

The app can be deployed locally via the Flask development server, or to any [Google Cloud serverless](https://cloud.google.com/serverless) compute platforms, [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine), [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions), or [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run), with just minor configuration changes.
